# DataFrames provide a great way to explore and analyze tabular data, but sometimes a picture is worth a thousand rows and columns. 
#The Matplotlib library provides the foundation for plotting data visualizations that can greatly enhance your ability the analyze the data.

# Ensure plots are displayed inline in the notebook
%matplotlib inline

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Create a bar plot of name vs grade
plt.bar(x=df_students.Name, height=df_students.Grade)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Note that you used the pyplot class from Matplotlib to plot the chart. 
This class provides a whole bunch of ways to improve the visual elements of the plot.
For example, the following code:

Specifies the color of the bar chart.
Adds a title to the chart (so we know what it represents)
Adds labels to the X and Y (so we know which axis shows which data)
Adds a grid (to make it easier to determine the values for the bars)
Rotates the X markers (so we can read them)
# Create a bar plot of name vs grade
plt.bar(x=df_students.Name, height=df_students.Grade, color='orange')

# Customize the chart
plt.title('Student Grades')
plt.xlabel('Student')
plt.ylabel('Grade')
plt.grid(color='#95a5a6', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, axis='y', alpha=0.7)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
